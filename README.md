# Web Speech API Demo with React + TypeScript

A comprehensive demonstration of the Web Speech API using React, TypeScript, and Vite. This project showcases both Speech Recognition and Speech Synthesis capabilities with a clean, modern interface.

## üöÄ Features

### Speech Recognition
- Real-time speech-to-text conversion
- Continuous recognition with interim results
- Clear visual feedback for listening status
- Transcript management with timestamps
- Error handling and browser compatibility checks

### Speech Synthesis (Text-to-Speech)
- Convert text to natural-sounding speech
- Multiple voice options with language support
- Adjustable speech parameters (rate, pitch, volume)
- Playback controls (play, pause, resume, stop)
- Real-time status indicators

### Voice Commands Demo
- Interactive voice command recognition
- Visual feedback through background color changes
- Demonstrates practical use of the speech recognition hook
- Simple command parsing system

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **React 18** - UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better developer experience
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **ES6+** - Modern JavaScript features
- **Web Speech API** - Browser-native speech capabilities

## üéØ Usage

### Using the Speech Recognition Hook

```typescript
import { useSpeechRecognition } from './hooks/useSpeechRecognition';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const {
    isListening,
    transcript,
    interimTranscript,
    error,
    isSupported,
    startListening,
    stopListening,
    toggleListening,
    clearTranscript,
  } = useSpeechRecognition({
    continuous: true,
    interimResults: true,
    lang: 'en-US',
  });

  // Your component logic here
};
```

### Configuration Options

The `useSpeechRecognition` hook accepts the following options:

- `continuous` (boolean): Keep recognizing speech continuously
- `interimResults` (boolean): Get results while speaking
- `lang` (string): Language code (e.g., 'en-US', 'es-ES')
- `maxAlternatives` (number): Maximum number of alternative transcripts

## üåê Browser Compatibility

The Web Speech API has limited browser support:

### Speech Recognition
- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge (Desktop & Mobile)
- ‚úÖ Safari (macOS & iOS)
- ‚ùå Firefox (not supported)
- ‚ùå Opera (limited support)

### Speech Synthesis
- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge
- ‚úÖ Firefox
- ‚úÖ Safari
- ‚úÖ Opera

**Note:** Always check for browser compatibility and provide appropriate fallbacks.

## üîí Permissions

Speech Recognition requires microphone access. Users will be prompted to grant permission when starting recognition for the first time.

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Voice Commands

Edit `src/components/VoiceCommandDemo.tsx`:

```typescript
const commands: Command[] = [
  {
    phrase: 'your-command',
    action: () => {
      // Your action here
    },
    description: 'Say "your-command" to trigger this action'
  },
  // Add more commands...
];
```

### Styling

The project uses inline styles for demonstration purposes. You can easily convert to CSS modules, styled-components, or your preferred styling solution.

## üêõ Known Issues

- Speech recognition may stop after periods of silence
- Some browsers require HTTPS for speech recognition
- Voice availability varies by operating system and browser

## üí° Tips

1. **For best recognition results:**
   - Use a good quality microphone
   - Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
   - Minimize background noise

2. **For speech synthesis:**
   - Test different voices to find the most natural sounding one
   - Adjust rate and pitch for better comprehension
   - Some voices may not support all languages

3. **Development tips:**
   - Use Chrome DevTools for debugging
   - Test on multiple devices and browsers
   - Consider implementing fallbacks for unsupported browsers
