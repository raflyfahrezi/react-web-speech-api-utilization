- Playback controls (play, pause, resume, stop)
- Real-time status indicators
- **Custom `useSpeechSynthesis` hook for reusability**

### Voice Commands Demo
- Interactive voice command recognition

## üéØ Usage

### Using the Speech Recognition Hook

```typescript
import { useSpeechRecognition } from './hooks/useSpeechRecognition';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const {
    isListening,
    transcript,
    interimTranscript,
    error,
    isSupported,
    startListening,
    stopListening,
    toggleListening,
    clearTranscript,
  } = useSpeechRecognition({
    continuous: true,
    interimResults: true,
    lang: 'en-US',
  });

  // Your component logic here
};
```

### Using the Speech Synthesis Hook

```typescript
import { useSpeechSynthesis } from './hooks/useSpeechSynthesis';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const {
    speak,
    cancel,
    pause,
    resume,
    speaking,
    paused,
    supported,
    voices,
    error,
  } = useSpeechSynthesis({
    rate: 1,
    pitch: 1,
    volume: 1,
  });

  // Speak text
  const handleSpeak = () => {
    speak('Hello world!');
  };

  // Your component logic here
};
```

### Configuration Options

**`useSpeechRecognition` options:**
- `continuous` (boolean): Keep recognizing speech continuously
- `interimResults` (boolean): Get results while speaking
- `lang` (string): Language code (e.g., 'en-US', 'es-ES')
- `maxAlternatives` (number): Maximum number of alternative transcripts

**`useSpeechSynthesis` options:**
- `rate` (number): Speech rate (0.5 to 2)
- `pitch` (number): Voice pitch (0 to 2)
- `volume` (number): Speech volume (0 to 1)
- `voice` (SpeechSynthesisVoice): Specific voice to use
- `lang` (string): Language code

## üåê Browser Compatibility

The Web Speech API has limited browser support:

### Speech Recognition
- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge (Desktop & Mobile)
- ‚úÖ Safari (macOS & iOS)
- ‚ùå Firefox (not supported)
- ‚ùå Opera (limited support)

### Speech Synthesis
- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge
- ‚úÖ Firefox
- ‚úÖ Safari
- ‚úÖ Opera

**Note:** Always check for browser compatibility and provide appropriate fallbacks.

## üîí Permissions

Speech Recognition requires microphone access. Users will be prompted to grant permission when starting recognition for the first time.

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Voice Commands

Edit `src/components/VoiceCommandDemo.tsx`:

```typescript
const commands: Command[] = [
  {
    phrase: 'your-command',
    action: () => {
      // Your action here
    },
    description: 'Say "your-command" to trigger this action'
  },
  // Add more commands...
];
```

### Styling

The project uses inline styles for demonstration purposes. You can easily convert to CSS modules, styled-components, or your preferred styling solution.

- UI components styled with modern CSS

## üêõ Known Issues

- Speech recognition may stop after periods of silence
- Some browsers require HTTPS for speech recognition
- Voice availability varies by operating system and browser

## üîç Key Differences: Speech Recognition vs Speech Synthesis

- **Speech Recognition** (Speech-to-Text): Converts spoken words into text
  - Listens through microphone
  - Transcribes human speech
  - Use cases: Voice typing, voice commands

- **Speech Synthesis** (Text-to-Speech): Converts text into spoken words
  - Speaks through speakers
  - Generates synthetic speech
  - Use cases: Screen readers, audiobooks

## üí° Tips

1. **For best recognition results:**
   - Use a good quality microphone
   - Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
   - Minimize background noise

2. **For speech synthesis:**
   - Test different voices to find the most natural sounding one
   - Adjust rate and pitch for better comprehension
   - Some voices may not support all languages

3. **Development tips:**
   - Use Chrome DevTools for debugging
   - Test on multiple devices and browsers
   - Consider implementing fallbacks for unsupported browsers
   - The custom hooks make it easy to add speech features to any component
